# Card Game Final Project - OOP2

## Overview

This project, accomplished as a part of the Object Oriented Programming 2 course, is an Android application developed in Java. Inspired heavily by the popular game "99 Cards", the purpose of this project was to showcase the principles of object-oriented programming.

## Game Description

The card game is a solitaire-like experience. Here's how it works:

* The player starts with four empty piles and a hand filled with cards numbered from 1 to 98.
* Two of the piles are designed to be in decreasing order, and the other two in increasing order.
* The player places cards on these piles following the respective order, and the hand gets replenished from the card stash.
* The ultimate goal is to place as many cards as possible before either running out of cards or reaching a situation where no more cards can be placed.
